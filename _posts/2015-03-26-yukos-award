<h2>Abstract:</h2>
In July 2014, the Hague issued a ruling that the Russian government had wrongly seized the Yukos oil company from its shareholders and was required to pay restitution in the amount of $50 billion. The following February, Russia appealed the court decision. This article reviews the case, Russiaâ€™s arguments, and the possibility that the award will be paid.
