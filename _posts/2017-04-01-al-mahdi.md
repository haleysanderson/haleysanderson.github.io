<h2>Abstract:</h2>
“Justice did not tremble,” reported French newspaper <i>Le Monde</i> on September 29, 2016, describing the conclusion of this historic case at the International Criminal Court (ICC). <i>Prosecutor v. Al Mahdi</i> was replete with “firsts” for the Court: first prosecution for destruction of cultural heritage; first prosecution of an Islamic extremist; first case regarding Mali; first guilty plea.
