<h2>Abstract:</h2>
In July 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit resuscitated one of the longest-running Holocaust restitution cases in the U.S. federal courts. The decision concerns a stolen Pisarro painting and provides insight in applying foreign law and the Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act of 2016 in such claims.
