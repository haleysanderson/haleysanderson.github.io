<h2>Abstract:</h2>
The questions of what lies outside sovereigns’ authority and when individuals may rightfully resist sovereigns’ commands are crucial, both to the understanding of the history of political thought and to considering our modern world. And at the bleeding edge of this inquiry sits the matter of the impossible—whether sovereigns have a right to command what cannot be carried out, and what relationships subjects  have to such commands. Does a sovereign have a right to order a circle to be square? Or to order a table to eat grass?  More urgently, can a sovereign rightfully order a person to change their beliefs? An innocent subject to be killed? Or can they rightfully command suicide? And if a sovereign issues such a command, may a subject resist? To what extent? We can find useful lenses through which to view these latter questions by considering the responses of two early theorists of sovereignty, Thomas Hobbes and Baruch Spinoza. Both were particularly interested in the intersection between sovereigns’ and subjects’ rights with respect to that which human nature renders “impossible,” and both faced widespread condemnation for their views.
