<h2>Abstract:</h2>
The rules governing lawsuits against foreign sovereigns in U.S. courts are tangled. An ad-hoc patchwork of doctrines that ultimately fail to recognize what makes sovereigns different from other defendants has developed as a result of the lack of attention paid to what it means to litigate against foreign sovereigns across procedural and substantive domains. These make a mess of the concept of sovereignty itself.

This Article diagnoses the jumbled view of sovereignty underlying these doctrines and seeks to challenge it by advocating for sustained engagement with what I term the doctrine of sovereign distinction—the collection of rules from across procedural and quasi-procedural domains governing how and why sovereigns are treated differently from other defendants. Part I lays out the current state of jurisprudence governing suits against foreign sovereigns in U.S. courts. It focuses on the three key areas mentioned above: personal jurisdiction, service of process, and injunctive relief. Part II highlights the disjointedness—even incoherence—of the current doctrine by contrasting their treatment to that of foreign private entities, raising the question of on what basis the U.S. legal system distinguishes sovereigns from private entities. Part III seeks to answer this question by drawing on possible theories of sovereignty from international law and political theory, and it concludes none can make sense of the conflicting ways sovereigns and private entities are, or are not, distinguished from one another. Finally, Part IV builds on Part III to call for the realignment of the doctrine of sovereign distinction along lines that would be justifiable on at least a minimal theory of sovereignty as entailing sovereign equality and the prima facie inviolability of sovereigns' territory and domaines réservés. Ultimately, this Article argues such a concept of sovereignty indeed requires certain differences in treatment between foreign sovereigns and foreign private entities, while rendering others unjustifiable. But the current rules have it backwards and consistently adopting this sovereignty concept would reshape personal jurisdiction, service of process, and injunctive relief to generate a theoretically and legally grounded doctrine of sovereign distinction.
