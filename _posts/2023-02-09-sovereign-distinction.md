<h2>Abstract:</h2>
U.S. law differentiates between two categories of foreign defendants—sovereign and private. On one level, whether a foreign entity is considered sovereign determines whether they are presumptively entitled to immunity from suits in U.S. courts under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, and this is justified by the nature of sovereignty as articulated in U.S. and international law. However, different procedural rules also apply to these types of parties, meaning the “sovereign or not” determination impacts not only immunity but also other rules of the game. This Article proposes conceiving of the ways that procedural rules do or do not differ between foreign sovereign and foreign private defendants as “procedural sovereign distinction,” laying out treatment of these defendants across personal jurisdiction, service of process, and injunctive relief. Current procedural sovereign distinction doctrine has lost track of the concept of sovereignty that ostensibly separates these types of parties, creating a mismatch between the justification for the distinction and the way the distinction is applied. At a minimum, we should acknowledge this mismatch exists. But we also might consider revising the doctrine of procedural sovereign distinction to promote the value of legal rules fitting and being justified by the principles underlying the legal system.
