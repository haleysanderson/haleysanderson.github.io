<h2>Abstract:</h2>
Foreign sovereign immunity doctrine creates two categories of foreign defendants—sovereign and non-sovereign. On a substantive level, whether a foreign party is considered sovereign determines whether they are presumptively entitled to immunity from suits in U.S. courts under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, and this is justified by the nature of sovereignty as understood in the Early American Republic and international law. However, different procedural rules also apply to these two types of parties, meaning the “sovereign or not” determination impacts not only immunity but also other rules of the game. This Article proposes conceiving of the ways that procedural rules do or do not differ between sovereign and non-sovereign foreign defendants as "procedural sovereign distinction," laying out treatment of these two types of defendants across service of process, personal jurisdiction, and injunctive relief. I argue our current procedural sovereign distinction doctrine has lost track of the concept of sovereignty that ostensibly separates these types of parties, creating a mismatch between the justification for the distinction and the way the distinction is applied. At a minimum, we should acknowledge that this mismatch exists, but we also might consider revising our doctrine of procedural sovereign distinction to promote the value of coherence in law.
