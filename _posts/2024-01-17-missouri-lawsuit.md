<h2>Abstract:</h2>
The Eighth Circuit has breathed life back into Missouri’s attempts to hold the People’s Republic of China (PRC) responsible in U.S. court for the COVID-19 pandemic. Missouri filed this claim in April 2020 and, as Chimène Keitner <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/69817/missouris-lawsuit-doesnt-abrogate-chinas-sovereign-immunity/">outlined</a> at the time, the case is rife with Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) issues. This latest decision characterizes the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as a “foreign state” under the FSIA, highlights a disputed reading of the FSIA’s commercial activities exception, and offers a reminder of intensifying anti-China politics during the pandemic.
