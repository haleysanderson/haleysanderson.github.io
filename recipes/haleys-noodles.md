4. Add garlic to butter. Stir until slightly browned.
5. Add soy sauce, red pepper flakes, and brown sugar. Stir to combine.
6. Add water. Stir for a few seconds until the sauce resembles a sauce.
7. Toss veggies into sauce and sti to coat.
8. Reduce heat to medium-low.
9. Push veggies to one side of the pan and crack eggs into other side of the pan. 
10. Stir the eggs periodically as they cook to scramble them. Start by stirring only on the egg side, then feel free to incorporate the veggies as the eggs get close to done.
11. Once eggs are cooked, add cooked noodles to pan. Toss noodles with veggies, eggs, and sauce.
12. Transfer concoction to bowl and top with optional chopped scallions.
