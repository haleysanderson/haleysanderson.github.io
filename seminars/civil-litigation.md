<h4>Seminar Idea</h4>
This course examines issues at the cutting edge of civil litigation in the United States. Each week, students will engage with a new topic in civil procedure, complex litigation, federal courts, or related subjects that has impacted legal practice in recent years. Assigned materials are drawn from a range of sources, including court documents, news articles, blog posts, and other scholarly commentary. 

If the seminar were running in Fall 2025, it would cover topics such as:
<ul>
	<li>Discovery and other transparency mechanisms related to litigation financing.</li>
	<li>Due process limitations on personal jurisdiction under the Fifth Amendment and the Supreme Court's June 2025 ruling in <i>Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Organization</i>.</li>
	<li>Generative AI and emerging certification and sanctions practices at the local level.</li>
	<li>The prospects for injunctive class actions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and "nationwide vacatur" under the Administrative Procedures Act in light of the Court's June 2025 ruling in <i>Trump v. CASA</i>.</li>
</ul>

One or two weeks on the syllabus will also be set aside to accommodate relevant developments during the semester, with scheduling adjusted as needed. 

Grading will be based on a combination of regular participation, a blog post, and a final paper. For the blog post, students will be (to the greatest extent possible) evenly distributed across the weeks of the semester. The students assigned for a given week will be asked to write 1000-1500 words commenting on that week's readings and then they will be responsible for introducing the topic in class that week. For the final paper, students will write on a civil litigation topic of their choosingâ€”either one covered during the semester or one identified outside class and approved by the instructor. The final paper should be a piece of persuasive writing that: 1) informs readers about the development; 2) explains why the development is significant; 3) critiques or defends the development, taking into account other relevant practices, policies, and legal rules; and 4) offers a short proposal for future action. This seminar will be particularly well-suited to those looking to begin work on their student note.
