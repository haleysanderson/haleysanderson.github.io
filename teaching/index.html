My goal as an instructor is to create an open, engaging, and inclusive learning environment that stimulates critical thinking and encourages active participation. I am transparent with students about my high expectations for them, and I believe my role as an instructor is to ensure that students are challenged to learn and grow. But I am also determined to support them in rising to the occasion.

<h4>Evaluations</h4>
There are many well-documented reasons to worry about the validity and value of student evaluations of teaching. I have found them largely helpful, however, and I am happy to share available anonymized evaluations here:
<ul>
  <li> <a href = "/assets/evals/L6561-F24.pdf">LLM Legal Research and Writing</a> (Fall 2024)</li>
  <li> <a href = "/assets/evals/LS106WI-S24.pdf">Philosophy of Law, Writing-Intensive Section</a> (Spring 2024)</li>
  <li> <a href = "/assets/evals/LS157-F23.pdf">International Law and International Relations</a> (Fall 2023)</li>
  <li> <a href = "/assets/evals/LS100-S23.pdf">Foundations of Legal Studies</a> (Spring 2023)</li>
  <li> <a href = "/assets/evals/PS112B-F22.pdf">History of Political Theory: Renaissance to Early Modern</a> (Fall 2022) -- <i>NB: I participated in the strike across the University of California system November–December 2022 and, in conjunction with the strike, did not perform my usual task of prodding students to complete evaluations. Unsurprisingly, the response rate for this semester was particularly low.</i></li>
  <li> <a href = "/assets/evals/LS154-S22.pdf">Human Rights, Research and Practice</a> (Spring 2022)</li>

</ul>

A sample of the comments from student evaluations that have been most meaningful to me are:
<ul>
  <li>"Professor Anderson . . . is an exceptional teacher who made the class engaging even though constrained by relatively dry subject matter. She was a clear communicator and gave helpful feedback. It is obvious that she takes an interest in the students and supporting them to achieve the goals of the class and the course more widely." (LLM Legal Research and Writing, Fall 2024)</li>
  <li>"She skillfully guided us through the structure of a legal memo, the preparation of a case brief, and how to identify and apply relevant rules using the IRAC method. Her teaching on the distinctions between federal and state courts was equally excellent, breaking down complex legal structures with precision. Professor Anderson's organized approach and her ability to simplify intricate concepts made these foundational topics of US law accessible and engaging." (LLM Legal Research and Writing, Fall 2024)</li>
  <li>"Haley gives constructive, specific, and honest feedback. . . . Whenever I turned in a piece of writing, she left several, long comments and questions which challeng[ed] me to think deeper about what I ha[d] written. Her feedback was always insightful, she made me think about things that I would not have considered. She challenged me to think about my ideas from a new perspective. She pushed me to develop a critical mindset." (Philosophy of Law, Writing-Intensive Section, Spring 2024)</li>
  <li>"The constant reminders in section 'make sure to cite evidence, and have a clear opening statement, and come to office hours to ask questions' have made me become a more engaged student in my other classes because I felt like I had more confidence (by virtue of more understanding) to do well on assignments." (International Law and International Relations, Fall 2023)</li>
  <li>"The cold–calling method of engagement kept me on my toes, so it challenged me to stay on top of the readings and lecture topics. Haley also maintains a very organized and intuitive approach to discussion topics that successfully conveyed the information she wanted to impart upon us." (Foundations of Legal Studies, Spring 2023)</li>
  <li>"Haley answered any questions we had from lecture, gave great feedback for our papers, was overall very knowledgeable of the material, and really helped me understand the concepts from our readings which helped me write better essays." (History of Political Theory, Fall 2022)</li>
  <li>"Haley is great at prodding and expecting evidence to back up an opinion. I developed the skill of using the law or real–world examples to back up my arguments." (Human Rights, Research and Practice, Spring 2022)</li>
  <li>"Exemplifies clear passion for both the material and students, which was strongly felt throughout the course. Always made time to be available as a resource, and truly cared about students as people too." (Theories of Law and Society, Fall 2021)</li>
</ul>
